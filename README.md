This is a Program meant for Basic encryption and decryption processes.

It will only work on windows machines...

If you want it to work on macintosh/Linux etc., remove the "maximize console" part. 

To make the program work, in the "Pass.txt", enter the md5 hashed of your password and enter the password when prompted.

Create files as per the instructions in the program before execution of segments.

Making hidden signs towards the key and shifts for the encryption are preffered.

Use it well.
