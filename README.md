# [JoCrypt](http://jocrypt.sidjo.repl.run)
### Click to Try/Run it on Repl

Encryption Program.

# MySQL Support

All the records of encryptions will be maintained. MySQL needs to be installed on your system for it obviously.
For the ease of finding a record, A username is given to you(by yourself) everytime you operate the program.
All encryptions will be saved under that username and will be timestamped. The message you wanted to encrypt will also be saved for future references.

### If you are unable to run MySQL on your device, You will have to run the JoCrypt_NoDB.py . It is the same as the original file only limitation is no record is maintained and no MySQL is required. 


# Executable

You can Convert any script to an executable using py2exe so it can work on a machine with no python.
Very Handy indeed.


# Support for Linux and Android
Now this framework can be run on Linux and Android.
All you have to do is clone the whole repository and run only the JoCryptL.py.
It the legacy edition in which all the windows kernel functions have been removed.

To run it on Android,download Termux and clone the repository in the linux environment.
Running this project on Android is not recommended due to horrible/no support for ascii art.

## Packages
### Make sure these packages are installed in your system:
#### os
#### msvcrt
#### subprocess
#### ctypes
#### PIL
#### itertools
#### hashlib
#### stegano
#### math

## Run 'setup.py'

This is a Program meant for Basic encryption and decryption processes.

It will only work on windows machines...

If you want it to work on macintosh/Linux etc., remove the "maximize console" part. (Done in JoCryptL.py)

To make the program work, in the "Pass.txt", enter the md5 hashed of your password and enter the password when prompted. Default --> "SecurePassword@!"

Create files as per the instructions in the program before execution of segments or run setup.py

Making hidden signs towards the key and shifts for the encryption are preffered.

Use it well.
