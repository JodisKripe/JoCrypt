# JoCrypt

Encryption Program.

###### Run 'setup.py'

This is a Program meant for Basic encryption and decryption processes.

To make the program work, in the "Pass.txt", enter the md5 hashed of your password and enter the password when prompted.

Create files as per the instructions in the program before execution of segments.

Making hidden signs towards the key and shifts for the encryption are preffered.

Using git clone on mobile will work just as fine in programs like 'termux', only, "Steganography" and "Anagram" wont work

Use it well.
